### How To Play
This is a 1v1 style way to play mario kart with a friend. My roommate and I played a lot and eventually got bored after mastering 200cc so we developed another game to play. Everything described below is how we would play. I would recommend adjusting, removing, or adding your own rules to best fit your play style.

Half of the spaces on the board are racers. In order to claim the space you must win a round of races with that character. We would play 4 races in a round but you can adjust that as you see fit.

When a racer is claimed, that space is permently won and no one can use that racer.

Extra points can be won by surronding a space with claimed racers. For example, in the image above, spa29 is surronded by red. If Adrian wins a round as Boy Squid, then he can claim spa29 as his. The program should capture this automatically. Corners also count as capturable.

Thats about it. Go nutz
